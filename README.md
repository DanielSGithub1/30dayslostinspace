Daniel Subelsky Github Account For 30 Days Lost In Space:

Day 1	 Learned how to write basic C++ code to turn led lights on and a second later off.				
Day 2	" Learned how to define the LED Lights. Learned how to write a loop to turn on and off the lights repeatedly.				
Day 3	Learned where to put each wire (GND, 12, 11, 10, etc.) Used a switch to turn on and off the LED lights.				
Day 4	We learned about 3 different lights and used the Switch to turn on different ones depending on the situation.				
Day 5	Creative Day #1: I Coded 6 different lights using the switch by having 2 different positions on each switch for 6 LEDs. 				
Day 6	We Learned how to use a serial monitor and used them to show light level on the monitor					
Day 8	We used a led with 4 different colors and made it dim and brighter				
Day 9	We did the same thing but different colors meant different battery percentages. 				
Day 10	Creative Day #2: I built a nightlight; when it was dark it would be blue and it would be off with it was light				
Day 11	Made a password by coding a keypad with custom buttons.				
Day 12	We made a song by pressing buttons on a keypad like before				
Day 13	We made a stronger password by that i tells you when you got it wrong and doesent allow access to other things but when you get it right you do get access. 				
Day 14	We made more improvements to this by adding a custom message when you get access				
Day 15	Create Day #3: Make it more secure by only saying the custom message after you get all 4 digits.				
Day 16	We Used a new clock or timer to display numbers				
Day 17	we solved some crypted code to display numbers on the clock/timer. 				
Day 18	We used a knob to turn the depth of the ship which showed up on the clock/timer				
Day 19	Make text on the clock/timer.				
Day 20	Creative Day #4: Make certain buttons change the color of an LED light				
Day 21	Learned how to code a screen and display stuff on it in the code				
Day 22	Continue Working on teh screen and display the next part.				
Day 23	We being working on the hard luanch system with the clock and screen				
Day 24	Use every component so far to begin coding to launch into the air				
Day 25	Create custom codes using all the components				
Day 26	Begin coding the luanch system with all the components				
Day 27	Made an image on the screen using code				
Day 28	Begin Projecting the launch on the screen using controls on the keypad, 				
Day 29	Finished the project by going home and watching the video as we going back to earth.
